## Project prototype

### Part 1: The user arrives at the homepage to browse Dreamcast games released in 1998. They hover over the "Browse Games" button to expand the accordion list.

### Part 2: The user is now at the blank search page.

### Part 3: The user opens the Year dropdown and selects 1998.

### Part 4: The user gets an unsorted list of games released in 1998, from several different consoles. They narrow their search further by opening the Console dropdown to select Dreamcast games.

### Part 5: The search is filtered to only show Dreamcast games. One of the games that appears is a game the user already owns, as indicated by the checked "I own this" box.
