# Game-Organizer

## Overview

The Game Organizer is intended to be an easy and convenient way for people to organize their game
collections. Based on the Lego database site Brickset, the Game Organizer would allow users to browse
through a database containing several console games from across several years, and they would be able
to tag which games they own and which ones they want. The games stored in the database would
contain several parameters users can filter their search by, to make finding games much easier. Along
with potential forum features, or just simply linking to dedicated discord servers, the site would allow
players to organize their collections and connect with others with similar interests.
